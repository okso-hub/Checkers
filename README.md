## Game Play
Checkers is played by two players.

Each player begins the game with 12 discs and places them on the 12 dark squares closest to him or her.

Black opens the game, then players alternate their turns.

Randomly determine who gets the black pieces first. When playing a series of games, the players alternate who gets the black pieces

## Move
The pieces always move diagonally and single pieces are always limited to forward moves.

A piece making a non-capturing move may move only one square.

## End of the game
A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move.

This happens usually because all of the opponent's pieces have been captured, but it could also be because all of his pieces are blocked in.
